		<h1 class="headings shadow">User Experience</h1>
		<p class="p-justified">I look at every line of code imagining myself as a first time user contemplating if the interface is intuitive, pleasant to experience, and if it draws me to return. The goal is to optimize user experience focusing on load speed by caching data or preloading. If preloading isn’t possible, distract the user with something they like. In some cases, that could be a floating tennis ball.</p>

		<h1 class="headings shadow p-right">DRY Code</h1>
		<p class="p-justified">Taking the ring to Mordor and second-breakfast doesn’t always need to be two separate functions. Striving to code efficiently is the ever guiding quest of a code warrior. Object literals in JavaScript or Classes in Ruby are two classic methods used to follow the acronym of "Don't Repeat Yourself."</p>

		<h1 class="headings shadow">Testing</h1>
		<p class="p-justified">I’m pretty sure most web developers use a browser DOM more often than a text editor when developing code. Testing and fixing bugs can easily comprise 80% of development. For smaller projects, the DOM is your best friend. For more complex undertakings that will have many iterations, a testing framework (like Mocha) is an indispensable tool. It's responsible and good practce to test every step of the way.</p>

		<p class="p-justified">Every good developer bookmarks resources to find answers to code problems that stump them. However, sometimes the fastest way to get over a hurdle is to respectfully ask the coder next to you for a hand. Become extremely familiar with your digital resources, but don't be afraid to utilize your team, as well. Helping each other out builds positive relationships.</p>

	<h1 class="headings shadow">Hi!</h1>
	<h1 class="headings shadow">I’m Mike.</h1>
	<p class="p-left"> I build websites from scratch and work with teams on large sites. I’ve been working with web code professionally for over three years at companies such as Foxconn and Apple, but longer on my own.</p>
	<p class="p-left"> My first experience with programming began at twelve. I discovered a love of algebra and practical thinking that taught me more about cause, effect, and consequence than school ever did. I remember, as a geeky, nerdy kid, converting the story of Star Wars into an algebraic formulae. If anyone in my family had been a programmer, they would have set me on this course much earlier. As an adult programmer, I hope to help other kids realize their coding potential sooner than I had.</p>
	<p class="p-left"> Coding is a true art that utilizes multiple disciplines. It embraces mathematics through algorithms, psychology through anticipating user experience, creativity, architecture, leadership, and teamwork. It’s the most personally fulfilling career choice I could have ever made. I anticipate working alongside robots to better the world a couple hundred years from now.</p>

	<div class="photos left culture">
		<div class="photo-glow"></div>
	</div>
	<h1 class="headings shadow">Culture</h1>
	<h1 class="headings shadow">Fit</h1>
	<p class="p-left">Why can’t we all just get along? Well, because we’re not the same person with the same history. We are diverse and that’s a really good thing more than it is a pain. I remind myself of this when I need to tolerate difficult personalities. And what if I’m the difficult personality that others are tolerating? I try to minimize friction by modeling the behavior I want to experience from others. These would be: Directness tempered by kindness and perspective. Embracing teamwork and not becoming too ego-attached to my [code] babies. Respectful humor and helpfulness. </p>
	<p class="p-left">I cannot stress enough that a positive culture is more important in a workplace than the project. If offered a choice between enduring demoralizing backstabbing at a cool AI/robotics company, or being respectfully embraced by a kind work-family at a sanitation plant, choose the sanitation plant every time. And then earn your right to be there.</p>
