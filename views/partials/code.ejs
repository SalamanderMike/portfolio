		<p class="p-justified">Look at every line of code imagining yourself as a first-time user. Contemplate if the interface is intuitive, pleasant, and would draw you to return. The goal is to optimize user experience such as focusing on load speed by caching data or preloading. If preloading isn’t possible, distract the user with something they like. In some cases, that could be a floating tennis ball.</p>

		<h1 class="headings shadow p-right">DRY Code</h1>
		<p class="p-justified">Taking the ring to Mordor and second-breakfast doesn’t always need to be two separate functions. Striving to code efficiently is the ever guiding quest of a code warrior. Object literals in JavaScript or Classes in Ruby are two classic methods used to follow the acronym of "Don't Repeat Yourself."</p>

		<p class="p-justified">I’m pretty sure most web developers use a browser's DOM just as often as a text editor when developing code. Testing and fixing bugs can easily comprise 80% of development. For smaller projects, the DOM is your best friend. For more complex undertakings that will have many iterations, a testing framework (like Mocha) is an indispensable tool. It's responsible and good practce to test every step of the way.</p>

		<h1 class="headings shadow p-right">Getting Help</h1>
		<p class="p-justified">Every good developer bookmarks resources to find answers to code problems that stump them. However, sometimes the fastest way to get over a hurdle is to respectfully ask the coder sitting next to you for a hand. Become extremely familiar with your digital resources, but don't be afraid to utilize your team, as well. Helping each other out builds positive relationships.</p>
